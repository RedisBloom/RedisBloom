RedisBloom adds four probabilistic data structures to Redis: a scalable **Bloom filter**, a **cuckoo filter**, a **count-min sketch**, and a **top-k**. These data structures trade perfect accuracy for extreme memory efficiency, so they're especially useful for big data and streaming applications.

**Bloom and cuckoo filters** are used to determine, with a high degree of certainty, whether an element is a member of a set.

A **count-min sketch** is generally used to determine the frequency of events in a stream. You can query the count-min sketch get an estimate of the frequency of any given event.

A **top-k** maintains a list of _k_ most frequently seen items.

## Bloom vs. Cuckoo filters
Bloom filters typically exhibit better performance and scalability when inserting
items (so if you're often adding items to your dataset, then a Bloom filter may be ideal).
Cuckoo filters are quicker on check operations and also allow deletions.
