# Bloom Filters


A Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure that enables you to check if an element is present in a set using a very small memory space of a fixed size.

Instead of storing all of the elements in the set, Bloom Filters store only the elements' hashed representation, thus sacrificing some precision. The trade-off is that Bloom Filters are very space-efficient and fast.

A Bloom filter can guarantee the absence of an element from a set, but it can only give an estimation about its presence. So when it responds that an element is not present in a set (a negative answer), you can be sure that indeed is the case. But one out of every N positive answers will be wrong. Even though it looks unusual at a first glance, this kind of uncertainty still has its place in computer science. There are many cases out there where a negative answer will prevent more costly operations, for example checking if a username has been taken, if a credit card has been reported as stolen, if a user has already seen an ad and much more.

## Sizing Bloom filters
In RedisBloom most of the sizing work is done for you: 

```
BF.RESERVE {key} {error_rate} {capacity} [EXPANSION expansion] [NONSCALING]
```

#### 1. False positives rate (`error_rate`)
The rate is a decimal value between 0 and 1. For example, for a desired false positive rate of 0.1% (1 in 1000), error_rate should be set to 0.001.

#### 2. Expected capacity (`capacity`)
This is the number of elements you expect having in your filter in total and is trivial when you have a static set but it becomes more challenging when your set grows over time. It's important to get the number right because if you **oversize** - you'll end up wasting memory. If you **undersize**, the filter will fill up and a new one will have to be stacked on top of it (sub-filter stacking). In the cases when a filter consists of multiple sub-filters stacked on top of each other latency for adds stays the same, but the latency for presence checks increases. The reason for this is the way the checks work: a regular check would first be performed on the top (latest) filter and if a negative answer is returned the next one is checked and so on. That's where the added latency comes from.

#### 3. Scaling (`EXPANSION`)
Adding an element to a Bloom filter never fails due to the data structure "filling up". Instead the error rate starts to grow. To keep the error close to the one set on filter initialisation - RedisBloom will auto-scale, meaning when capacity is reached an additional sub-filter will be created.  
 The size of the new sub-filter is the size of the last sub-filter multiplied by `EXPANSION`. If the number of elements to be stored in the filter is unknown, we recommend that you use an expansion of 2 or more to reduce the number of sub-filters. Otherwise, we recommend that you use an expansion of 1 to reduce memory consumption. The default expansion value is 2. 
 
 The filter will keep adding more hash functions for every new sub-filter in order to keep your desired error rate. 

Maybe you're wondering "Why would I create a smaller filter with a high expansion rate if I know I'm going to scale anyway?"; the answer is: for cases where you need to keep many filters (let's say a filter per user, or per product) and most of them will stay small, but some with more activity will have to scale. 

#### 4. `NONSCALING`
If you know you're not going to scale use the `NONSCALING` flag because that way the filter will use one hash function less. Just remember that if you ever do reach the initially assigned capacity - your error rate will start to grow.


### Total size of a Bloom filter
The actual memory used by a Bloom filter is a function of the chosen error rate:
```
bits_per_item = -log(error)/ln(2)
memory = capacity * bits_per_item
  
memory = capacity * (-log(error)/ln(2))
```

- 1% error rate requires 10.08 bits per item
- 0.1% error rate requires  14.4 bits per item
- 0.01% error rate requires  20.16 bits per item

Just as a comparison, when using a Redis set for membership testing the memory needed is:

```
memory_with_sets = capacity*(192b + value)
```

For a set of IP addresses, for example, we would have around 40 bytes (320 bits) per element, which is considerably higher than the 20 bits per element we need for a Bloom filter with 0.01% precision.



## Examples:

* Adding new items to the filter

> A new filter is created for you if it does not yet exist

```
> BF.ADD newFilter foo
(integer) 1
```

* Checking if an item exists in the filter

```
> BF.EXISTS newFilter foo
(integer) 1
```

```
> BF.EXISTS newFilter notpresent
(integer) 0
```

* Adding and checking multiple items

```
> BF.MADD myFilter foo bar baz
1) (integer) 1
2) (integer) 1
3) (integer) 1
```

```
> BF.MEXISTS myFilter foo nonexist bar
1) (integer) 1
2) (integer) 0
3) (integer) 1
```

* Creating a new filter with custom properties

```
> BF.RESERVE customFilter 0.0001 600000
OK
```

```
> BF.MADD customFilter foo bar baz
```

## Bloom vs. Cuckoo filters
Bloom filters typically exhibit better performance and scalability when inserting
items (so if you're often adding items to your dataset, then a Bloom filter may be ideal).
Cuckoo filters are quicker on check operations and also allow deletions.
