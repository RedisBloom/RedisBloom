is key name for a Bloom filter.

</details>

</details>

## Return value

Returns one of these replies:

- @array-reply of @integer-reply - where "1" means that, with high probability, `item` was already added to the filter, and "0" means that `key` does not exist or that `item` was definitely not added to the filter.
- @error-reply on error (invalid arguments, wrong key type, etc.)
