Returns, for each input rank, an estimation of the value (floating-point) with that rank.

Multiple estimations can be retrieved in a signle call.

## Required arguments

<details open><summary><code>key</code></summary>
is key name for an existing t-digest sketch.
</details>

<details open><summary><code>rank</code></summary>

Rank, for which the value should be retrieved.

0 is the rank of the value of the smallest observation.

_n_-1 is the rank of the value of the largest observation; _n_ denotes the number of observations added to the sketch.

</details>

## Return value

@array-reply - an array of floating-points populated with value_1, value_2, ..., value_R:

- Return an accurate result when `rank` is 0 (the value of the smallest observation)
- Return an accurate result when `rank` is _n_-1 (the value of the largest observation), where _n_ denotes the number of observations added to the sketch.
- Return 'inf' when `rank` is equal to _n_ or larger than _n_

All values are 'nan' if the sketch is empty.
