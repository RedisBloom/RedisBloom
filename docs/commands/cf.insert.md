Adds one or more items to a cuckoo filter, allowing the filter to be created with a custom capacity if it does not exist yet.

This command offers more flexibility over the `ADD` command, at the cost of more verbosity.

## Required arguments

<details open><summary><code>key</code></summary>

is key name for a cuckoo filter to insert items to.

If `key` does not exist - a new cuckoo filter is created.
</details>

<details open><summary><code>ITEMS item...</code></summary>

One or more items to insert.
</details>

## Optional arguments

<details open><summary><code>CAPACITY capacity</code></summary>
    
Specifies the desired capacity of the new filter, if this filter does not exist yet.
    
If the filter already exists, then this parameter is ignored.
    
If the filter does not exist yet and this parameter is *not* specified, then the filter is created with the module-level default capacity which is 1024.

See `CF.RESERVE` for more information on cuckoo filter capacities.
</details>
    
<details open><summary><code>NOCREATE</code></summary>
  
If specified, prevents automatic filter creation if the filter does not exist (Instead, an error is returned).
    
This option is mutually exclusive with `CAPACITY`.
</details>

## Return value

@array-reply of @integer-reply - where "1" means the item has been inserted to the filter, and "-1" means that the item was not inserted because the filter is full.

@error-reply on error (invalid arguments, wrong key type, etc.)
