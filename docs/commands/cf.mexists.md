Determines whether one or more items were added to a cuckoo filter.

This command is similar to `CF.EXISTS`, except that more than one item can be checked.

## Required arguments

<details open><summary><code>key</code></summary>

is key name for a cuckoo filter.

</details>

<details open><summary><code>item...</code></summary>

One or more items to check.
</details>

## Return value

Returns one of these replies:

- @array-reply of @integer-reply - where "1" means that, with high probability, `item` was already added to the filter, and "0" means that `key` does not exist or that `item` had not added to the filter. See note in `CF.DEL`.
- @error-reply on error (invalid arguments, wrong key type, etc.)
