Returns the cardinality of a Bloom filter - number of items that were added to a Bloom filter and detected as unique (items that caused at least one bit to be set in at least one sub-filter)

 (since RedisBloom 2.4.4)

### Parameters

* **key**: The name of the filter

@return

* @integer-reply - the number of items that were added to this Bloom filter and detected as unique (items that caused at least one bit to be set in at least one sub-filter).
* 0 when `key` does not exist.
* Error when `key` is of a type other than Bloom filter.

Note: when `key` exists - return the same value as `BF.INFO key ITEMS`.
