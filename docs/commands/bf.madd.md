## Return value

  - @integer-reply - where "1" means that the item has been added successfully, and "0" means that such item was already added to the filter (which could be wrong)
  - @error-reply when the item cannot be added because the filter is full
- @error-reply on error (invalid arguments, wrong key type, etc.)
